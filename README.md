Paint.JAVA
==========

I was annoyed at the lack of a suitable (Pinta is horrible, GIMP is overcomplicated and sucks at pixel art, etc.) equivalent of Paint.NET for Linux, and was unable to do pixel art for my games.
If you want something done well, you have to do it yourself it seems.

So, I am making a cross-platform Paint.NET clone.

Since I'm programming in Java, it's only right that it would be called Paint.JAVA

I'll put up a changelog here at some point, but for now I'm still setting up the repository.
